 *                and focus events. The component is designed to integrate
 *                seamlessly with SwiftUI views and provides a customizable
 *                and interactive search experience.
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è The `onTextChange` should probably just be a üëâ binding üëà, so maybe remove that? fix it later when transfereing code and comments from legacy etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Make `onFocus` a binding instead? üëà fix it later when transfering code and comments from legacy etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Possibly customize `NSSearchField` in the future etc (less custom code etc, do it when migrating to SwiftUI / Catalyst)
